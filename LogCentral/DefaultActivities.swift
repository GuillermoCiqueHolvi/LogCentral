 Activities are a low volume way of grouping logging statements. They are similar
 to breadcrumbs. There are typically three types of activities:
 
 - user: A user initiated activity (button click etc)
 - external: An external event (triggered by the os)
 - internal: An internal activity which helps divide the logs into logical parts
